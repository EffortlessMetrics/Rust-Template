//! Core business logic for the Rust-as-Spec platform cell.
//!
//! This crate defines the domain model and governance traits used by the
//! rest of the workspace, including:
//! - `TaskRepository` – persistence boundary for task state
//! - `Task` types (from `model` crate) – core task lifecycle
//!
//! Adapters (HTTP handlers, database drivers, event systems) implement these
//! ports to provide concrete storage and transport. The kernel treats this crate
//! as the source of truth for governance semantics.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - No dependencies on HTTP, database, or other infrastructure adapters
//! - Adapters (app-http, app-db, etc.) call core, never the reverse
//! - Core defines ports (traits), adapters implement them

/// Ports (interfaces) for task persistence and storage.
pub mod ports;

/// Use cases (application logic) for task operations.
pub mod use_cases;

/// Governance domain model for task management.
pub mod governance;
